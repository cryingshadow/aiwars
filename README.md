# aiwars

Project for the "Technologie-Trends" course of the Wirtschaftsinformatik master 2023 at the FHDW Mettmann

## Project Setup

The init-script.sh or init-script.bat script should be executed when the project is initially set up.
It copies the pre-commit hook into the hooks folder. 
The pre-commit hook protects you from checking in faulty/non-executable code into all branches of the repository if the configured automated tests fail.
